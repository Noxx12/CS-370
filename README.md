I was provided a reinforcement learning maze-solving AI foundation code for this project. I improved the AI's learning and decision-making by altering the exploration-exploitation trade-off, implementing experience replay, and improving training.
Computer scientists construct algorithms, develop software and systems, analyze data, and solve complicated issues. Their work improves technology, efficiency, and solves problems in healthcare, banking, and communication.
As a computer scientist, I first understand the issue domain, break down difficult tasks into smaller, manageable portions, and then create algorithms or systems to accomplish them efficiently. I ensure that my solutions are fair, transparent, and protect user privacy and rights.
